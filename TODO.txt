Order State History - OrderStateHistory dto, service, etc.  Maybe remove order state change dates from OrderItem?

Fix Inventory view bug - go to product view, delete a product, go to the inventory view, an exception is raised

The validation and business rules infrastructure is a bit smelly.  Figure out how to more easily create business rules and validation rules, or unify the interface and no longer expose ValidationResult, but use IRule and ValidationResult under the hood.  Look at some of the commands GetError() methods to see examples of why things are smelly.

BusinessBase - add concurrency business rule in update rather than throw concurrency exception?

Do we need GetValidationResult methods for get, getall, and delete?  IE, look at InventoryService.DecrementQOH and the usage of creating a validation rule.  Does this even make sense?  Seems like an exception should be thrown if supplied values aren't correct?  Think about this one....  maybe i originally designed it this way to support binding values?

Create tests for VM's and other framework - adding tests around VM's will ensure that future contributors who change the framework won't break the WPF app, revealing flawed logic

Add dynamic DI support to consumer projects


New Nuget releases

Figure out versioning strategy - branches or tags

Move sample projects into a different directory and remove project references, adding nuget refs instead
